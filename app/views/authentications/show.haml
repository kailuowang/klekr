          With klekr, you can add other artists' works and collections as sources.
          New pictures from these sources will be displayed in a single slideshow.
          klekr remembers your preference over these sources by looking at how you collect pictures.
          Thus klekr will be able to display the more interesting pictures first.

      Klekr links with your flickr account so that you don't have to create another one. Also, pictures you collect on klekr will be faved on flickr too :)
