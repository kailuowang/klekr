        klekr helps you explore and collect photos of your own taste.

          With klekr, you can add other artists' works and collections as sources.
          New pictures from these sources will be displayed in a single slideshow.
          klekr remembers your preference over these sources by looking at how you collect pictures.
          Thus klekr will be able to display the more interesting pictures first.

        Let's get started! â†“

    #stoppedRedirect.hidden
      %h3.mt20
        = link_to 'Click here to login from Flickr.com', @auth_url

      Klekr links with your flickr account so that you don't have to create another one. Also, pictures you collect on klekr will be faved on flickr too :)
